INSTALLATION ON LINUX
=====================

Requirements
============

The requirements below are verified by the configure script.

Build requirements:
* make
* an ANSI C compiler
* openssl >= 0.9.8
* libica >= 2.4.0a

Runtime requirements:
* openssl >= 0.9.8
* libica >= 2.4.0


Basic Installation
==================

$ ./configure [--enable-debug]
$ make
$ make install

This will configure, build and install the package in a default location,
which is /usr/local/lib. It means that the libibmca.so will be installed
in /usr/local/lib/libibmca.so by default. If you want to install it 
anywhere else, run "configure" passing the new location via prefix
argument, for example::

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/lib64/openssl/engines


Enabling IBMCA
==============

Included in this package is a sample openssl.cnf file (openssl.cnf.sample),
which can be used to turn on use of the IBMCA engine in apps where OpenSSL
config support is compiled in. 

In order to enable IBMCA, use the following instructions to apply the
configurations from openssl.cnf.sample to the openssl.cnf file installed 
in the host by the openssl package. WARNING: you may want to save the 
original openssl.cnf file before changing it.

1) In openssl.cnf.sample, the dynamic_path variable is set to the default 
location, which is /usr/local/lib/libibmca.so. However, if the libibmca.so 
library has been installed anywhere else, then update the dynamic_path
variable.

2) Locate where the openssl.cnf file has been installed in the host (e.g.
rpm -ql openssl | grep openssl.cnf) and append the openssl.cnf.sample file
to it.

$ cat openssl.cnf.sample >> /path/to/openssl.cnf

3) In openssl.cnf, move the openssl_conf variable from the bottom to the 
top of the file, such as in the example below:

HOME = .
RANDFILE = $ENV::HOME/.rnd
openssl_conf = openssl_def

4) Finally, check if the ibmca is now enabled. The command below 
should return the ibmca engine and all the supported cryptographic methods.

$ openssl engine -c

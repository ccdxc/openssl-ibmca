ABOUT

This package contains the dynamic IBMCA engine.

BUILDING

 Requirements: OpenSSL 0.9.8, libICA

 By default, the build will assume that you have a custom openssl installed
in /usr/local/ssl.

 $ configure [--enable-debug] [--with-openssl=/path/to/custom/openssl]
 $ make
 # make install

RUNNING

Included in this package is a sample openssl.cnf file
(openssl.cnf.sample), which can be used to turn on use of the IBMCA
engine in apps where OpenSSL config support is compiled in.

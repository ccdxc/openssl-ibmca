ABOUT

This package contains the dynamic IBMCA engine.

BUILDING

 Requirements: OpenSSL 0.9.8 (or higher), libICA

 $ configure [--enable-debug]
 $ make
 # make install

Included in this package is a sample openssl.cnf file (openssl.cnf.sample),
which can be used to turn on use of the IBMCA engine in apps where OpenSSL
config support is compiled in. In order to enable the IBMCA engine, the
content from this file should be concatenated to the existing openssl.cnf file
on the host.

The dynamic_path parameter within the sample openssl.cnf file must be
set to where the libibmca.so engine resides on the system. The engine
will most likely reside in the openssl engine directory for the system.
By default, it is set to,
dynamic_path = /usr/lib64/engines/libibmca.so

If the OpenSSL engines directory and libibmca.so is located elsewhere,
then that location must be specified in the dynamic_path parameter.
